description: Implementing basic login and registration, third-party authentication, and MFA verification using better-auth
---

Bunship has integrated [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) to provide a complete authentication solution, including basic email login/registration, third-party authentication, MFA verification, and Passkey features. The project has already implemented basic login and registration pages, available at `/signin` and `/signup` paths.

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Generate Security Key

First, generate a security key for encrypting sessions and tokens:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Add the generated key to your `.env` file:

```
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<your_generated_key>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=<your_application_url, e.g. http://localhost:3000>
```

## Supported Authentication Methods

### Email Login/Registration

Bunship has built-in email login and registration functionality. Simply visit the `/signin` and `/signup` pages to use these features. No additional configuration is needed; the system automatically handles email verification and account creation processes.

### Third-Party Authentication

The project supports various third-party login methods. To enable them, simply configure the corresponding environment variables:

```
# GitHub Login
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_github_client_id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>

# Google Login
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>
```

#### Obtaining Third-Party Credentials

##### GitHub OAuth Setup:
1. Visit [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the application name and redirect URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/github`)
4. After creation, copy the Client ID and generate a Client Secret

##### Google OAuth Setup:
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and add a redirect URI (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`)
5. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret

## Advanced Authentication Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Better Auth supports various MFA methods, including TOTP (such as Google Authenticator) and SMS verification codes. Bunship has integrated these features, allowing users to enable MFA in their account settings to enhance security.

### Passkey (WebAuthn) Support

Passkey allows users to log in using biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition) or device PIN codes without entering passwords. This feature is integrated into Bunship to provide users with a more convenient login experience.

## Additional Features and Customization
