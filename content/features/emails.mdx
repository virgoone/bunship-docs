description: Bunship uses resend and @react-email/components for email functionality
---

Bunship integrates [Resend](https://resend.com) and [@react-email/components](https://react.email) to provide email services, supporting verification emails, one-time verification codes, password reset functionality, and responsive email templates.

## Setting Up Resend

### 1. Create an Account

First, you need to create an account on the Resend platform:

1. Visit the [Resend website](https://resend.com) and sign up
2. Complete email verification
3. Create a domain or use Resend's testing domain

### 2. Obtain API Key

1. Log in to the Resend console
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click the "Create API Key" button
4. Name your key and create it
5. Copy the generated API key

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add the API key to your project's `.env` file:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Email Templates

Bunship uses React Email to create responsive email templates, all located in the `src/emails/templates` directory.

### Implemented Email Templates

Bunship has already implemented the following email templates:

1. **Email Verification** - Used to verify user email addresses
2. **One-Time Verification Code (OTP)** - Used for multi-factor authentication or login verification
3. **Password Reset** - Used for password reset workflows

### Previewing Email Templates

You can preview email templates locally using the following command:

```bash
bun email:dev
```

This will start a local server, typically at `http://localhost:3001`, where you can view and test all email template renderings in your browser.

## Creating Custom Email Templates

You can add custom email templates by creating new React components in the `src/emails/templates` directory.

### Template Example

Here's an example of an email template for sending a one-time verification code:

```tsx
import { Footer } from "@/emails/components/footer";
import { Logo } from "@/emails/components/logo";
import {
  Body,
  Container,
  Font,
  Head,
  Html,
  Preview,
  Section,
  Tailwind,
  Text,
} from "@react-email/components";

export default function RequestSendOtpEmail({
  name = "there",
  otp = "123456",
  expiresInMinutes = 10,
}: {
  name: string;
  otp: string;
  expiresInMinutes?: number;
}) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head>
        <Font
          fontFamily="Geist Mono"
          fallbackFontFamily="Verdana"
          webFont={{
            url: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Geist+Mono:wght@500&display=swap",
            format: "woff2",
          }}
          fontWeight={500}
          fontStyle="normal"
        />
      </Head>
      <Preview>Your Bunship verification code: {otp}</Preview>
      <Tailwind>
        <Body className="bg-white font-mono">
          <Container className="mx-auto py-5 pb-12 max-w-[580px]">
            <Logo />

            <Text className="text-xs leading-7 mb-6 font-mono">Hi {name},</Text>

            <Text className="text-xs leading-7 pb-2 font-mono">
              Here is your verification code for Bunship:
            </Text>

            <Section className="py-4">
              <Text className="text-center font-mono text-2xl tracking-widest font-bold bg-gray-100 py-4 rounded-md">
                {otp}
              </Text>
            </Section>

            <Text className="text-xs leading-7 mt-3 font-mono">
              This code will expire in {expiresInMinutes} minutes. Please enter
              it on the verification page to complete your sign-in process.
            </Text>

            <Text className="text-xs leading-7 mt-4 font-mono">
              If you didn&#x27;t request this code, you can safely ignore this
              email.
            </Text>

            <Text className="text-xs leading-7 mt-4 font-mono">
              For security reasons, never share this code with anyone. Bunship
              team will never ask you for this code.
            </Text>

            <Footer />
          </Container>
        </Body>
      </Tailwind>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

## Sending Emails

Bunship has implemented email sending methods in `@/lib/auth`. These methods are used for:

1. Sending email verification emails
2. Sending one-time verification codes
3. Sending password reset links

### Email Sending Example

```typescript
import { Resend } from "resend";
import { render } from "@react-email/render";
import RequestSendOtpEmail from "@/emails/templates/request-send-otp-email";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function sendOtpEmail(email: string, name: string, otp: string) {
  try {
    const html = render(
      <RequestSendOtpEmail 
        name={name} 
        otp={otp} 
        expiresInMinutes={10} 
      />
    );
    
    await resend.emails.send({
      from: "Bunship <noreply@bunship.example.com>",
      to: email,
      subject: "Your verification code",
      html: html,
    });
    
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to send email:", error);
    return { success: false, error };
  }
}
```

## Custom Email Components

In addition to creating complete email templates, you can create reusable email components such as headers, buttons, and footers. Bunship provides some common components in the `src/emails/components` directory.

### Creating Custom Components

For example, creating a custom button component:

```tsx
// src/emails/components/button.tsx
import { Button as EmailButton } from "@react-email/components";

export function Button({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <EmailButton
      href={href}
      className="bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-md"
    >
      {children}
    </EmailButton>
  );
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

1. Check if the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly
2. Verify that the sender address is validated on the Resend platform
3. Check the Resend console for any sending errors

### Email Styling Issues

1. Use `bun email:dev` to preview emails and ensure styles are correct
2. Different email clients have varying CSS support; use inline styles when possible
3. Using React Email's built-in components can improve email compatibility
